# Evaluation Forms for 42 Project Cursus
This repository contains the evaluation forms for all 42 projects in the cursus. The forms are designed to assess the performance of students on each project and provide feedback for improvement. The forms are organized by project number and include a section for comments and grading. Currently, the forms are available in French only, but English versions will be added as soon as possible.
